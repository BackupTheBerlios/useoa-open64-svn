Chris:

Here is a package of stuff that constitutes a two dimensional
CFD solver utlizing Newton's method with a finite difference Jacobian and direct
(banded) linear algebra.  The package includes:

1. The fortran code.  It should compile correctly under f77 on a Sun
Sparcstation, giving only some warnings about performance degradation due to
alignment.  Note:  this code is not for public distribution.
Also note that this code is 10+ years old, and passes virtually everything
through common (a not "uncommon" procedure, even today, in the CFD world).
It is not a Boeing application code, but should be reasonably representative
of a Newton-based flow solver.

2. An input file that is read in as unit 5 (standard input).

3.  Another input file (a bunch of initialization data) that is read in as
unit 11 (fort.11).

4.  An output file that shows what a correct execution with the given input
produces.  Execution takes about 1 minute with a sparc-1 cpu.

As you will see, the jacobian computation is done by NUMJAC, and the "function
evaluator" is FORMEQ.  The dependent variables are EQ, and the independent
variables are U.  The jacobian is stored in a banded format that is explained in
the header of NUMJAC.

I will be out of town Oct 22-25, back at work Oct 28.

Thanks...Greg Shubin
