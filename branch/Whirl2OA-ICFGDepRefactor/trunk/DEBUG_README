you can get OpenAnalysis debugging by setting the OA_DEBUG
environment variable:

setenv OA_DEBUG "DEBUG_ManagerSideEffectStandard:DEBUG_CalleeToCallerVisitor"

turns on debugging in the SideEffectManager and the CalleeToCallerVisitor.

You can find these DEBUG_* defines in the constructors of OpenAnalysis
classes.
