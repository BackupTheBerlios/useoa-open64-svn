    Minor edits to make things work with OpenAnalysis rev 126.
    - Changed some ExprHandles to CallHandles
    - Outputing the results of ParamBindings, but don't have
      ParamBindings regression tests set up yet.

    - small change in an std::cout statement in test-open.cpp that 
      was causing some ordering differences in the output when 
      compared accross different compilers.
      This might be similar to the issue that Luis is seeing in the CFG
      output where the CFG node id appears after certain statements.
