    CallGraph regression tests and all other regression tests in
    regressAll.script pass after OpenAnalysis rev 118 changes
    where the CallGraph now uses alias results.

6/28/06     UseOA-Open64 svn trunk r32    Luis Ramos
    test-open64.cpp, removed dump calls from cfg and replaced
    them with cfg->output and outputDOT statements, as used for
    regression tests.

    ReachDefs regression tests results added for CFG analysis.
    Files include: 
    interalias_proc_call3_rd.B, reachdef_if1.B, reachdef_if2.B
    reachdef_loopif1.B 

6/29/06     UseOA-Open64 svn trunk r33    Luis Ramos
    New regressReachDefs with the new endline filter results

    Minor edits to make things work with OpenAnalysis rev 126.
    - Changed some ExprHandles to CallHandles
    - Outputing the results of ParamBindings, but don't have
      ParamBindings regression tests set up yet.

7/5/06     UseOA-Open64 svn trunk r35    Michelle Strout
    - small change in an std::cout statement in test-open.cpp that 
      was causing some ordering differences in the output when 
      compared accross different compilers.
      This might be similar to the issue that Luis is seeing in the CFG
      output where the CFG node id appears after certain statements.

     - added the beginnings of regression tests for ICFG
	  - not yet ready for prime time in regressAll.script
          - in script/
                - added ICFG.test, genICFG.script, regressICFG.script
          - in TestCases/
                - added ICFG/, ICFG/nested_calls_1.f, ICFG/nested_calls_1.B
          - in TestResults/
                - added ICFG/


7/7/06     UseOA-Open64 svn trunk r41    Barbara Kreaseck
     - updated UseOA-Open64 regression outputs to work with OpenAnalysis
       trunk r136, which has changes to CallGraph, and output from CallGraph,
       and some extra spaces in outputting a map in general.

        ==> significant output changes in TestResults/CallGraph/*
        ==> spacing changes in outputs in TestResults/AliasMapFIAlias/*
        ==> spacing changes in outputs in TestResults/ParamBindings/*

7/14/06     UseOA-Open64 svn trunk r42    Barbara Kreaseck
    - added regression tests for ICFG, added to regressAll
    - modified CFG and ReachDef output in test-open64.C
    - works with OpenAnalysis r141

7/17/06     UseOA-Open64 svn trunk r43    Barbara Kreaseck
    - re-gen'd ICFG regression output to work with OpenAnalysis trunk r147
    - passes regressAll with OpenAnalysis r147 compiled on Okapi with gcc-3.2

7/19/06     UseOA-Open64 svn trunk r44    Michelle Strout
    - added stuff for regression testing AliasMapXAIF, but it isn't quite
      working yet.  There is something wrong with InvisibleLocs.
    - regressAll works with OpenAnalysis r153
