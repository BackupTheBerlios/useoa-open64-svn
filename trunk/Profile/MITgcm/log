* useful 1: Started profiling ICFGUseful analysis for OpenAnalysis revision 798.

* useful 2: modified ICFGDep::getMayDefsIterator, ICFGDep::getDiffUseIterator
            functions to remove many calls to find and thus save some time.

* ad_input_code_sf.B.out.SecondSuggestion.profile
          : Exachanged the order of two for loops in the transfer() of
            ManagerICFGUseful and ManagerICFGVaryActive
            We used to iterate over IN/OUT data flow set and then 
            iterating over Uses/Defs in the statment. Now, we swap
            the order.
