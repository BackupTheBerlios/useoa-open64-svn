- In ManagerICFGUseful::meet(set1,set2), I am always doing the following:
     a. retval = clone of remapSet1
     b. *retval = retval->unionEqu(remapSet2)


Here I tried Two possibilities:

1) above, I removed the use of an assignment statement.  That is making
   an extra copy into *retval when it already has the union result.
   Now, I just try:
     a. retval->unionEqu(remapSet2);


2) Try to find out if it make a difference in the time of the unionEqu()
   routine if I call it using the small set on the big set

  Change the code to be:
  if (remapSet1->size() > remapSet2->size()) {
      retval = clone of remapSet1
      retval->unionEqu(remapSet2)
  } else {
      retval = clone of remapSet2
      retval->unionEqu(remapSet1)
  {
